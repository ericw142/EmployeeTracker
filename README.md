# EmployeeTracker

## Description
This is a command line application that allows you to interact with an Employee database quickly and conveniently. Currently it allows you to create, read, update and delete information from three main tables- the employee table, the role table, and the department table. You can use this application to easily view and manage information regarding employees with different roles, from different departments.
